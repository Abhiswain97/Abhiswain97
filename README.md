### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Abhishek !

A final year undergrad passionate about machine learning, data science & statistics. 

My idea of learning new things or following my interests is best described by one my favorite physicists, Richard Feynmann: 
> *"What I cannot create, I do not understand"*

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [*MyVision*](https://github.com/Abhiswain97/MyVision) which is a wrapper over PyTorch I built to help me abstract things and do more with less code. It's a work in progress  and I welcome you to contribute to it.
  - I am also interested in building a deep learning framework in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or C++ atleast try so tht I can understand the underlying details of algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Statistical foundations of learning(deeper dive into maths behind ML/DL) & putting in beginner steps into Competetive Programming.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project involving ML/DL/DS.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything ML/DL/Computer vision. I will try my best to answer or point you to a resource.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [*Linkedin*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-s-4a20819a/)

I also have a personal blog: [*Listening To Life*](https://abhiswain97.github.io/ListeningToLife/).
You can check it out if you're interested. I write about anything & everything I love! 

I also post on [*Towards data science*](https://medium.com/@abhi08as.as) things like tutorials, or simply documenting what I build.
